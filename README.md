# custom_malloc.  
A tiny and optimized custom allocator in pure C based on malloc

(Atm the better version is in the rework branch)...  


## TODO.  
- Threading (need to be thread safe over pthread and MPI).  
- Branching optimization and bin research.  
- Security mitigations.  
- Refine between SSE and AVX in block research.  
- Improve the code structure.  
- Maybe a garbage collector...
